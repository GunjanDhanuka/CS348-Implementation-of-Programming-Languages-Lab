## Assignment 2

Name: Gunjan Dhanuka
Rollno: 200101038

### Remarks:

- input file should be present in the same directory as the C++ code, and must contain the assembly code
- "output.txt" will contain the required machine code and will be generated at the end of the execution. 
- "intermediate_file.txt", "optable.txt", "symbol_table.txt" files will be generated by the program during pass 1.
- Any error faced during the code execution will be printed in the terminal
- New instructions must begin in a new line
- Comments should begin with '.'
- Fields in the input file must be separated by a single space (along a row)
- The opcodes present in 'System Software An Introduction To Systems Programming' book have been implemented and the same conventions as the book have been followed
- Other than the opcodes included above assembler directives- "START", "END", "RESB", "RESW", "BYTE" and "WORD" have been implemented


### Steps for running:

Compile using:
`g++ A2_200101038.cpp`

Run using:
`./a.out <input file name>`
